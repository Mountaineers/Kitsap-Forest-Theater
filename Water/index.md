# Water

We used to get water for the Kitsap Cabin from down by the theater - there was a spring on the other side of Chico Creek that supplied the water. You can still see some of the water pipes on the trail that was used to get the water up the hill to the cabin. By the time I was involved, they had dug a well up top to get water. Later they build a new pump house that takes care of the water - it is between Kitsap Cabin and the Caretaker's house.<sup>[Gala email](../Person/Gala-Lindvall/2022-06-02-Water)</sup>
