For those who find the trips to Snoqualmie Lodge too ambitious, the Mountaineer's summer home, Kitsap Cabin, seems to fill a real need. Recently, the old farm house has been deserted for a new cabin on the clearing overlooking Hidden Ranch, where little parties or large gather for jolly evenings before the new fireplace that everyone has had a hand in making. No matter what the weather, Kitsap Cabin and the Rhododendron Park have a fascination. Even in the rain the tall pines ,with their festoons of gray moss seem to hold out a melancholy comfort to the belated home seeker, while in fine weather they stretch their heights upward with a fresh invigorating grace that seems to encourage the waving rhododendrons and to make way for the best view of sparkling huckleberry and lacy-patterned kinnikinnick. With vistas through the forests and glimpses of the blue distance and more wooded hills across the valley of Hidden Ranch, the lovers of Kitsap Cabin never are bored and never lose enthusiasm. This year the immediate and absorbing interest has been the building of the new home. The chairman of the Committee, Harry .Myers, displayed the most untiring energy in getting the Cabin built in six months, almost entirely by the work of members of the Club, who have given their week-ends ungrudgingly to do their bit. As a result the summer has brought little parties every week, and big "helping hand" parties every mouth to Kitsap. Here everyone turned shaker or splitter or hod carrier according to his particular inclination, and each Sunday the Cabin seemed to swarm like a hive of very earnest bees. This intimate association with one another. with the beautiful forest playground, with Hidden Ranch and its poet philosophers, Mr. Paschall and Mary Paschall, have made the new Cabin very dear to those Mountaineers who have been able to enjoy its privileges.

On some of the special trips quite unique entertainments have been featured and staged. The May Day Fete was perhaps the most delightful one. For who would not love to see L. A. Nelson, the dignified, decked out in all the splendor of a May Queen, with Peter McGregor and Harry Myers as ladies in waiting upon the Queen, and all intensely proud of trains and long curls. With these distinguished and imposing leaders of a gay procession, and all the regalia that is needed to create the illusion of an old English May Day Fett>. with tlH' lovely idyllic setting of the little valley of Hidden Ranch, on a tender sunshiny morning, no spectacle could have been more bewitchingly humorous, or ludicrously romantic. It is just this combination of imagination and romance, with the saving grace of spontaneous fun that makes the charm of Mountaineer entertainments always. Kitsap Cabin has had its Romany Camp fire too, with gypsy lads and lassies dancing in a ring, someÂ·of them fierce enough in appearance to be the survivors of the lost tribes. A circus there was, a Hallowe'en festival, a kitchen shower and finally the formal dedication of the Cabin itself, with stores of its history, told by the people who really had a hand in its making, as well as in the acquiring of the Rhododendron Park, such people as our pioneer President, Edmond S. :Meany, Peter McGregor, Mary Paschall and Redick McKee.

But no account of the building of Kitsap Cabin is complete without some mention of the individual work of Mary Paschall, who as amateur contractor and general overseer of the job, was always there and ever diligent for the best interests of the Club; and Otto Voll whose skill and resourcefulness have added so many conveniences, as well as artistic touches to the cabin, and who never knew what it meant to stop work until vociferous calls for dinner had come sounding through the woods.

THE KITSAP LODGE

by ARTHUR L. Loveless

When we think of the Kitsap Lodge, those of us who love it, we do not call to mind the weather-beaten, decrepit relic of some early settler's losing fight to conquer the stony soil, which stands in unabashed and unlovely nakedness by the edge of the forest, staring across the little clearing. Instead we conjure up a picture of a habitation nestling among the second growth of the plateau above the valley, guarded by the tall firs, and lulled to sleep by the music of their voices as they nod and whisper to each other. This dream is as yet unrealized, but the hope of its fulfillment makes the problems of decaying timbers and sagging corners of the present log house, of wells which are empty, or else too much inhabited, and how to build a $75.00 fireplace for $15.00 seem mere trifles. And when they get too difficult-the problems-we go down to Hidden Ranch and listen to "Fiddle and I" and forget our troubles. And as we toil up the long incline to our own property, stopping often for breath and a backward look at that most restful of all spots, Peaceful Valley, we go back to work with renewed energy and enthusiasm.

For a building which will suitably house us, is, of course, a thing we have constantly in mind. Until that plan becomes a reality the present log house can be made to serve, though its timbers are rapidly rotting away. What form the future Lodge will take, or even its exact site, has not been fully determined, although a building with living and cooking accommodations only, with individual sleeping quarters some distance away, has been discussed. Such an arrangement, while it would permit the night owls to keep the echoes awake all night, would also permit the early birds to get their beauty sleep, and go out searching for the worm as near daylight as they wished, without any heated discussion the next day as to proper hours for retiring and rising.

A considerable amount of permanent improvement to the property has been completed during the year. The land has been surveyed by R. H. McKee, the old corners located, and the boundary lines laid out. The fire trails, which define these lines, and serve as a means to fight possible fires, are also under way. A few hours' work at cutting some of the stubborn growth of underbrush which forms the thickets about the property is really necessary to make one properly appreciate the joys of a workless day at the Lodge.

Since an adequate water supply is a pre-requisite to any future building, a well has been dug near the future site of the Lodge, under the direction of Edward Triol, which it is hoped will furnish sufficient water for all purposes. It is located in a clearing in the center of a little cluster of cedars, which has long been christened "The Chapel," from the dim seclusion of which one looks out, as from a room, on the level plateau and across the valley to Baldy.

On Helping Hand Day in the Spring, much work was done on the Bennett trail from Bolton's to the Lodge. This new avenue of approach to the Lodge property, up the gentle incline of the gulch, through the tangled undergrowth of the forest, forms a pleasing contrast to the open road over burned off land, through Duesler's, though it does not equal in charm the old trail to Hidden Ranch along the
banks of the stream, among the giant cedars.

While the work done so far has been mainly confined to the Lodge property, once this has been properly developed, there are several useful trails which can be opened up to render the vicinity of the Lodge more accessible, and furnish objectives for hikes for those so inclined. One such trail has already been cut out, that around Kitsap Lake, which was made by Irving Clark and Jack Tusler early in the Spring. It would be improved by a little more work upon it. One to Baldy and return by a different route, another from Kitsap Lake to Lost Creek, and still another from Hidden Ranch to Wildcat Lake offer possibilities for strenuous work.

A number of scheduled outings were held during the year which were well attended. The rain, which beat a tattoo upon the dinner plates at the Rhododendron outing, served to raise rather than dampen the spirits of the crowd. During the Spring and Summer nearly every Sunday saw a small party enjoying the Lodge or its environs, and if hay mows proved often more enticing sleeping quarters than the ground, who shall say if they were not often well earned luxuries.

The green depths of the woods furnished a perfect background for the performance of Robin Hood which was held on the morning of the Rhododendron walk at different points along the trail, actors and audience moving from point to point as the scenes changed. The gay costumes of the performers lent an agreeable touch of color to the monotoned woods, whose staid trees had doubtless never witnessed such a gladsome frolic as took place in the shade of their drooping branches. There are endless possibilities in performances of this character, and it would seem desirable to give vent to the play spirit of the Mountaineers through more of such channels.

The full moon and crisp air were the one touch needed to evoke the spirit of Hallowe'en, which brought in its train headless horsemen, ghosts and goblins, and various elfish pranks on the Hallowe'en outing in October.

No account of Kitsap Lodge would be complete without some reference to our neighbors on the hill and in the valley, whose warm hospitality, and friendly advice and assistance add so much to the attractiveness of the place, and make one realize what true neighborliness means. Indeed, without them, Kitsap Lodge would lose half its charm.

The Kitsap Rhododendron Preserve.

by Mary R. Paschal

p. 67

A new departure of the Mountaineers during the present year was the purchase of seventy-four acres of upland in Kitsap County for a rhododendron preserve. It has since been surveyed by Mr. R. H. McKee, assisted by several club members who volunteered their services for the long and arduous task. Their measurements show it to be a rectangular tract, approximately one-half mile from east to west by one-fourth mile from north to south. It includes several acres of cleared land besides a large forested area and embraces a portion of Wildcat Valley with about one hundred
twenty-five feet of the running stream. The contour is rugged and full of surprises, especially in the ravines, while a series of parklike enclosures on the bench land on the southwest, offer ideal locations for evening campfires.

The farm buildings found on the property are constructed of fir logs, are well roofed and are at present adequate to shelter week-end campers. The main house has been equipped with a good range and cooking utensils whi,le members have contributed many additional household articles, including band-made benches and chairs. The upper story is assigned for the use of the women, while the barn, with an airy haymow and lean-to, has been set apart for the men. The subject of family cabins, for use when several parties register at the same time, is of especial interest to the married members. It has been suggested that one-room buildings with facilities for making a fire might secure for them the necessary comfort and privacy. Three such are ready for slight remodeling. A satisfactory water supply has thus far proved most puzzling, as the present well is adequate for drinking purposes for only half the year and quite dry during September. There is, however, abundant flow of water in Wildcat Creek, and the springs near the southeast corner seem to be constant.

Next to water supply the matter of trails is of vital importance. A clean-cut boundary would serve not only to define the limits of the property but also to check fire which is a constant menace. The rhododendrons do not recover for many years after burning and the timber is irreparably damaged. When the fire trail is completed several others of peculiar beauty will no doubt be opened. The Bennett-Curtis trail, which is the first new one, drops quietly down into the
 
p. 68

hundred-foot ravine in front of the house and terminates near the northeast corner stake. It might be continued down the full length of the valley, and connect eventually with the Jogging road for Kitsap Lake. The trail along the north line, westward to the corner, should eventually join a water-grade trail to Wildcat lake, and there should be a direct route to Baldy by way of Lost Creek. The present short cut to Seabeck, across Big Beef Valley, is already uaed by guests from Kitsap Lodge, who are enthusiastic over its varied windings through forest and field.

Yet strong as is the Jure of the outgoing trails, there is nothing of greater interest to lovers of the open than the forest gardens of rhododendron which rival in gorgeous display the irised fields of the mountain meadows of the high Cascades. The largest of these has almost a level floor. On one hand rise the tan spars of fir trees, on the other a valley drops sheer a hundred and fifty feet into deep green meadows, where two little rivers join hands and run to the sea. When late spring flJJs the vaJJey with clover bloomsthe hiJI gardens are flushed with masses of pink, as though a sunrise had suddenly become tangi ble. Each bush is painted a different shade, each flower cluster holds a sphere of separate flowers as translucent as soap bubbles, each tiniest floweret is crumpled on its margin like a seasheJI and mottled in the throat as perfectly a_s a lily. To look upon it even once in the hush of early morning, when the world is fresh with dew and the thrushes are repeating their matin song, is to have lived deeper. There is in this garlanded amphitheatre unique opportunity for welcoming May as it has not been welcomed since the hawthorne graced the hedgerows of old England in the time of Good Queen Bess.

It is difficult to speak of the park and overlook the wild tenants whose title is so much older than ours. The smalJer animals include the Douglas squirrel, the variable hare, the mountain beaver, the muskrat, the raccoon, the mink, the weasel and the otter, with an occasional coyote, a wildcat, or a shy black bear. None, however, have frequented it more or marked out so perfect a network of trails for our laggard feet to folJow as the timorous deer that haunts the wild places of the park as a last safe feeding ground. No bit of wild life, though, will be so likely to arrest the attention of the casual wanderer as the sprightly water ouzeJ when he sings in the November rain beside the stream where the great salmon make their submarine demonstratioM. He sings whenever he is lucky enough to flnd a salmon egg, sings in the hope of another, sings because of the down pour, and sings because he simply must sing in a world so full of motion and music and light.

The query as to the future purpose of the Kitsap property is perhaps partially answered by the use which has been made of it since May 6th when it was first opened. Of the four hundred nine members and guests who registered in the six months, two hundred twenty-three are included in the annual rhododendron walk. The remainder came in small parties. The Kitsap preserve is a park in the larger sense, and as such will have more significance as time passes. It may well be styled the kindergarten of the club as the beautiful Snoqualmie Lodge in its mountain environs, is the finishing school.

In these lower playgrounds lies everybody's chance to become a pioneer in woodcraft, to learn to make a fire in the rainstorm, to follow the unmapped forest with only his compass, to read the writing on the trail. When he knows his forest as the seaman knows his sea he is prepared in a peculiar sense to go forth alone and unafraid in answer to the trumpets of the winds that are ever calling man up into the high mountains.
