#### GitHub Pages Help

(this can be deleted at any time it's not useful to someone with a last name of "Lindvall".)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Mountaineers/Kitsap-Forest-Theater/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

When you commit to the gh-pages branch of this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages, from the content in your Markdown files.
