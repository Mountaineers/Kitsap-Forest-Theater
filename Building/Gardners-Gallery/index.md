# History

#### 2018

- Roof needs to be done again by professional volunteer to replace all with new plywood and new shingles. The upper portion was replaced by a professional volunteer and the quality is much better.

#### 2013

- New roof joists installed, new plywood, and new shingles.

#### 2012

- Volunteers spent three full-day work parties tearing off the lower roof section of the building and replacing some of the rotten boards, and re-roofing with rolled roofing.
