# About

This web site is a continuation of a legacy left by the caretakers and other [historian](Person/Historian)'s.

This site is designed to be an authoritative and comprehensive source of information about Kitsap Forest Theater, Hidden Valley, and the Rhodendrum preserve. It collates and organizes information collected from [sources](Source) and aims to be as complete and accurate as possible.

The source is in the Kitsap-Forest-Theater [repository](https://github.com/Mountaineers/Kitsap-Forest-Theater/tree/gh-pages) on GitHub. The pages are formatted in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), the easiest to learn and use markup language for writing web pages. Committee members are invited to send Matt their GitHub username to be added to the organization. Users with little git experience are recommended to try [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). GitHub users can fork the repo, make changes, and submit Pull Requests.

The site theme is [ultra](https://github.com/ronv/ultra). The publishing engine is jekyll and [can be run locally](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/).
